          <p>
            I am a versatile professional with a diverse background in teamwork,
            emergency response, management, and entrepreneurship. As an Eagle
            Scout and paramedic, I honed my skills in leadership and emergency
            handling. I later founded a successful woodworking business,
            utilizing technology like AutoCAD to achieve high precision and
            client satisfaction. My passion for technology led me to a software
            engineering boot camp, where I mastered multiple programming
            languages. I'm now seeking an entry-level software developer
            position to apply my skills in creating efficient and user-friendly
            applications. Click the links below to learn more or get in touch.
